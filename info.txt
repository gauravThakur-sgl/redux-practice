# Todo List Application Architecture

## Overview

The todo list application will be built using React, Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application will have the following features:

1. **Add Todo**: Users can add new tasks to the todo list.
2. **Edit Todo**: Users can edit the details of an existing task.
3. **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks from the todo list.
4. **Pending**: Tasks that are yet to be completed.
5. **Completed**: Tasks that have been marked as completed.

## File Structure

The file structure for the application will be as follows:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── TodoItem.js
│   ├── TodoList.js
│   ├── AddTodo.js
│   ├── EditTodo.js
│   └── PendingTodos.js
│   └── CompletedTodos.js
├── redux/
│   ├── actions.js
│   ├── reducer.js
│   └── store.js
├── styles/
│   └── global.css
├── App.js
└── index.js
```

### Components

1. **TodoItem.js**: Represents a single todo item and handles actions like editing and deleting the todo.
2. **TodoList.js**: Displays the list of todos, both pending and completed.
3. **AddTodo.js**: Provides a form for adding a new todo item.
4. **EditTodo.js**: Provides a form for editing an existing todo item.
5. **PendingTodos.js**: Displays the list of pending (incomplete) todo items.
6. **CompletedTodos.js**: Displays the list of completed todo items.

### Redux

1. **actions.js**: Defines the action creators for the todo list application.
2. **reducer.js**: Implements the Redux reducer to handle state updates.
3. **store.js**: Sets up the Redux store and connects it to the application.

### Styles

1. **global.css**: Contains the global Tailwind CSS styles for the application.

### Entry Points

1. **App.js**: The main entry point of the application, which renders the todo list components and connects them to the Redux store.
2. **index.js**: The starting point of the application, which renders the `App` component.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set up the project**: Create a new React project using a tool like Create React App or Next.js. Install the necessary dependencies, including Redux and Tailwind CSS.

2. **Create the Redux store**: In the `redux/store.js` file, create the Redux store and configure the middleware (if any).

3. **Define the actions**: In the `redux/actions.js` file, create the action creators for the todo list application, such as `addTodo`, `editTodo`, `deleteTodo`, `markAsCompleted`, and `markAsPending`.

4. **Implement the reducer**: In the `redux/reducer.js` file, create the Redux reducer to handle the state updates based on the actions.

5. **Create the components**: In the `components/` directory, create the components for the todo list application:
   - `TodoItem.js`: Renders a single todo item and handles editing and deleting.
   - `TodoList.js`: Renders the list of todos, both pending and completed.
   - `AddTodo.js`: Provides a form for adding a new todo item.
   - `EditTodo.js`: Provides a form for editing an existing todo item.
   - `PendingTodos.js`: Displays the list of pending (incomplete) todo items.
   - `CompletedTodos.js`: Displays the list of completed todo items.

6. **Connect the components to the Redux store**: In the `App.js` file, import the necessary components and connect them to the Redux store using the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks.

7. **Style the application**: In the `styles/global.css` file, use Tailwind CSS utility classes to style the application components.

8. **Test and refine**: Test the application thoroughly, ensuring that all features work as expected. Refine the UI, user experience, and any other aspects as needed.

By following this architecture and step-by-step implementation, you'll have a robust and maintainable todo list application built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional guidance!
